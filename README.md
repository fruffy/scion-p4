Open Source P4 Research Projects Relating to SCION
==================================================

Projects
--------
- [tofino-crypto](/tofino-crypto/): AES encryption and AES-CMAC for Tofino 2
- [tofino-pktgen](/tofino-pktgen/): SCION packet generator for Tofino 2
- [tofino-scion-br](/tofino-scion-br/): SCION border router's packet processing and forwarding part. Can be deployed with AES-CAMC in a single Tofino 2 switch to form an entire SCION BR.
- [tofino-epic-br](/tofino-epic-br/): SCION BR packet processing and forwarding with support for EPIC but missing support for SCION packets which require the validation of two hop fields. Can be deployed with AES in a single Tofino 2 switch.
